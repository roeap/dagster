# Resources

<Note>
  This guide covers using the new Pythonic resources system introduced in
  Dagster 1.3. If your code is still using the legacy resources system, see the{" "}
  <a href="/concepts/resources-legacy">Legacy resources guide</a>. To migrate
  your code, refer to the{" "}
  <a href="/guides/dagster/migrating-to-pythonic-resources-and-config">
    Migrating to Pythonic resources and config
  </a>{" "}
  guide.
</Note>

In data engineering, resources are the external services, tools, and storage you use to do your job. For example, a simple ETL (Extract Transform Load) pipeline fetches data from an API, ingests it into a database, and updates a dashboard. External tools and services this pipeline uses could be:

- The API the data is fetched from
- The AWS S3 bucket where the APIâ€™s response is stored
- The Snowflake/Databricks/BigQuery account the data is ingested into
- The BI tool the dashboard was made in

Using Dagster resources, you can standardize connections and integrations to these tools across Dagster definitions like [Software-defined Assets](/concepts/assets/software-defined-assets), [schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules), [sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), [ops](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/ops), and [jobs](/concepts/ops-jobs-graphs/jobs).

So, why use resources?

- **Plug in different implementations in different environments** - If you have a heavy external dependency that you want to use in production but avoid using in testing, you can accomplish this by providing different resources in each environment. Refer to the [Separating business logic from environments](/concepts/testing#separating-business-logic-from-environments) section of the Testing documentation for more info about this capability.
- **Surface configuration in the Dagster UI** - Resources and their configuration are surfaced in the UI, making it easy to see where resources are used and how they're configured.
- **Share configuration across multiple assets or ops** - Resources are configurable and shared, so configuration can be supplied in one place instead of individually.
- **Share implementations across multiple assets or ops** - When multiple assets access the same external services, resources provide a standard way to structure your code to share the implementations.

## Defining a resource

Typically, resources are defined by subclassing <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/>. Attributes on the class are used to define the resource's [configuration schema](/concepts/configuration/config-schema). The configuration system has a few advantages over plain Python parameter passing; configured values are displayed in the UI and can be set dynamically using environment variables. Binding resource config values can also be delayed so that they can be specified at run launch time.

### With Software-defined Assets

The following example demonstrates defining a subclass of <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> that represents a connection to an external service. The resource can be configured by constructing it in the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> call.

You can define methods on the resource class which depend on config values.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_configurable_defs endbefore=end_new_resources_configurable_defs dedent=4
from dagster import asset, Definitions, ConfigurableResource
import requests
from requests import Response

class MyConnectionResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str

    def request(self, endpoint: str) -> Response:
        return requests.get(
            f"https://my-api.com/{endpoint}",
            headers={"user-agent": "dagster"},
        )

@asset
def data_from_service(my_conn: MyConnectionResource) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    return my_conn.request("/fetch_data").json()

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[data_from_service],
    resources={
        "my_conn": MyConnectionResource(username="my_user"),
    },
)
```

Assets specify resource dependencies by annotating the resource as a parameter to the asset function.

To provide resource values to assets, attach them to the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> objects. These resources are automatically passed to the function at runtime.

### With sensors

[Sensors](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors) use resources in the same way as assets, which can be useful for querying external services for data.

To specify resource dependencies on a sensor, annotate the resource type as a parameter to the sensor's function. For more information and examples, refer to the [Sensors documentation](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors#using-resources-in-sensors).

### With schedules

[Schedules](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) can use resources in case your schedule logic needs to interface with an external tool or to make your schedule logic more testable.

To specify resource dependencies on a schedule, annotate the resource type as a parameter to the schedule's function. For more information and examples, refer to the [Schedules documentation](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules#using-resources-in-schedules).

### With ops and jobs

The following example defines a subclass of <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> that represents a connection to an external service. The resource can be configured by constructing it in the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> call.

You can define methods on the resource class which depend on config values.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_configurable_defs_ops endbefore=end_new_resources_configurable_defs_ops dedent=4
from dagster import Definitions, job, op, ConfigurableResource
import requests
from requests import Response

class MyConnectionResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str

    def request(self, endpoint: str) -> Response:
        return requests.get(
            f"https://my-api.com/{endpoint}",
            headers={"user-agent": "dagster"},
        )

@op
def update_service(my_conn: MyConnectionResource):
    my_conn.request("/update")

@job
def update_service_job():
    update_service()

defs = Definitions(
    jobs=[update_service_job],
    resources={
        "my_conn": MyConnectionResource(username="my_user"),
    },
)
```

Ops specify resource dependencies by annotating the resource as a parameter to the op function.

To provide resource values to ops, attach them to the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> objects. These resources are automatically passed to the function at runtime.

There are many supported config types that can be used when defining resources. Refer to the [advanced config types documentation](/concepts/configuration/advanced-config-types) for a more comprehensive overview of the available config types.

## Configuring resources

### Using environment variables with resources

Resources can be configured using environment variables, which is useful for secrets or other environment-specific configuration. If you're using [Dagster Cloud](/dagster-cloud), environment variables can be [configured directly in the UI](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/environment-variables-and-secrets).

To use environment variables, pass an <PyObject object="EnvVar" /> when constructing the resource. `EnvVar` inherits from `str` and can be used to populate any string config field on a resource. The value of the environment variable will be evaluated when a run is launched.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_env_vars endbefore=end_new_resources_env_vars dedent=4
from dagster import EnvVar, Definitions, ConfigurableResource

class CredentialsResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str

defs = Definitions(
    assets=...,
    resources={
        "credentials": CredentialsResource(
            username=EnvVar("MY_USERNAME"),
            password=EnvVar("MY_PASSWORD"),
        )
    },
)
```

**What about `os.getenv()`?** When `os.getenv()` is used, the value of the variable is retrieved when Dagster loads the code location. Using `EnvVar` not only tells Dagster to retrieve the value at runtime, but also not to display the value in the UI.

<!-- Lives in /next/components/includes/EnvVarsBenefits.mdx -->

<EnvVarsBenefits />

For more information on using environment variables with Dagster, refer to the [Environment variables guide](/guides/dagster/using-environment-variables-and-secrets).

### Configuring resources at launch time

In some cases, you may want to specify configuration for a resource at launch time, in the Launchpad or in a <PyObject object="RunRequest" /> for a [schedule](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules) or [sensor](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors). For example, you may want a sensor-triggered run to specify a different target table in a database resource for each run.

You can use the `configure_at_launch()` method to defer the construction of a configurable resource until launch time:

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_runtime endbefore=end_new_resource_runtime dedent=4
from dagster import ConfigurableResource, Definitions, asset

class DatabaseResource(ConfigurableResource):
    table: str

    def read(self):
        ...

@asset
def data_from_database(db_conn: DatabaseResource):
    return db_conn.read()

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[data_from_database],
    resources={"db_conn": DatabaseResource.configure_at_launch()},
)
```

#### Providing resource launch time configuration in Python code

Then, configuration for the resource can be provided at launch time in the Launchpad or in Python code using the `config` parameter of the <PyObject object="RunRequest" />:

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_runtime_launch endbefore=end_new_resource_runtime_launch dedent=4
from dagster import sensor, define_asset_job, RunRequest, RunConfig

update_data_job = define_asset_job(
    name="update_data_job", selection=[data_from_database]
)

@sensor(job=update_data_job)
def table_update_sensor():
    tables = ...
    for table_name in tables:
        yield RunRequest(
            run_config=RunConfig(
                resources={
                    "db_conn": DatabaseResource(table=table_name),
                },
            ),
        )
```

### Resources that depend on other resources

In some situations, you may want to define a resource that depends on other resources. This is useful for common configuration. For example, separate resources for a database and for a filestore may both depend on credentials for a particular cloud provider. Defining these credentials as a separate, nested resource allows you to specify configuration in a single place. It also makes it easier to test resources, since the nested resource can be mocked.

In this case, you can list that nested resource as an attribute of the resource class:

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resources_nesting endbefore=end_new_resources_nesting dedent=4
from dagster import Definitions, ConfigurableResource

class CredentialsResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str

class FileStoreBucket(ConfigurableResource):
    credentials: CredentialsResource
    region: str

    def write(self, data: str):
        get_filestore_client(
            username=self.credentials.username,
            password=self.credentials.password,
            region=self.region,
        ).write(data)

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[my_asset],
    resources={
        "bucket": FileStoreBucket(
            credentials=CredentialsResource(
                username="my_user", password="my_password"
            ),
            region="us-east-1",
        ),
    },
)
```

If it's preferred to provide the configuration for credentials at launch time, use the `configure_at_launch()` method to defer the construction of the `CredentialsResource` until launch time.

Because `credentials` requires launch time configuration through the launchpad, it must also be passed to the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object, so that configuration can be provided at launch time. Nested resources only need to be passed to the <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object if they require launch time configuration.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_dep_job_runtime endbefore=end_new_resource_dep_job_runtime dedent=4
credentials = CredentialsResource.configure_at_launch()

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[my_asset],
    resources={
        "credentials": credentials,
        "bucket": FileStoreBucket(
            credentials=credentials,
            region="us-east-1",
        ),
    },
)
```

## Managing state in resources

Once a resource reaches a certain complexity, you may want to manage the state of the resource over its lifetime. This is useful for resources that require special initialization or cleanup. `ConfigurableResource` is a data class meant to encapsulate config, but can also be used to set up basic state.

You can mark any private state attributes using Pydantic's [`PrivateAttr`](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/usage/models/#private-model-attributes). These attributes, which must start with an underscore, won't be included in the resource's config.

The `setup_for_execution` and `teardown_after_execution` methods can be overridden to initialize or teardown a resource before each run execution, and are free to modify any private state attributes.

In the following example, we set up an API token for a client resource based on the username and password provided in the config. The API token can then be used to query an API in the asset body.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_with_state_example endbefore=end_with_state_example dedent=4
from dagster import ConfigurableResource, asset
import requests

from pydantic import PrivateAttr

class MyClientResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str

    _api_token: str = PrivateAttr()

    def setup_for_execution(self, context) -> None:
        # Fetch and set up an API token based on the username and password
        self._api_token = requests.get(
            "https://my-api.com/token", auth=(self.username, self.password)
        ).text

    def get_all_users(self):
        return requests.get(
            "https://my-api.com/users",
            headers={"Authorization": self._api_token},
        )

@asset
def my_asset(client: MyClientResource):
    return client.get_all_users()
```

`setup_for_execution` and `teardown_after_execution` are each called once per run, per process. When using the in-process executor, this means that they will be called once per run. When using the multiprocess executor, each process's instance of the resource will be initialized and torn down.

For more complex use cases, you can override the `yield_for_execution`. By default, this context manager calls `setup_for_execution`, yields the resource, and then calls `teardown_after_execution`, but you can override it to provide any custom behavior. This is useful for resources that require a context to be open for the duration of a run, such as database connections or file handles.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_with_complex_state_example endbefore=end_with_complex_state_example dedent=4
from dagster import ConfigurableResource, asset
from contextlib import contextmanager
from pydantic import PrivateAttr

class DBConnection:
    ...

    def query(self, body: str):
        ...

@contextmanager
def get_database_connection(username: str, password: str):
    ...

class MyClientResource(ConfigurableResource):
    username: str
    password: str

    _db_connection: DBConnection = PrivateAttr()

    @contextmanager
    def yield_for_execution(self, context):
        # keep connection open for the duration of the execution
        with get_database_connection(self.username, self.password) as conn:
            # set up the connection attribute so it can be used in the execution
            self._db_connection = conn

            # yield, allowing execution to occur
            yield self

    def query(self, body: str):
        return self._db_connection.query(body)

@asset
def my_asset(client: MyClientResource):
    client.query("SELECT * FROM my_table")
```

## Using bare Python objects as resources

When starting to build a set of assets or jobs, you may want to use a bare Python object without configuration as a resource, such as a third-party API client.

Dagster supports passing plain Python objects as resources. This follows a similar pattern to using a <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> subclass; however, assets and ops that use these resources must [annotate](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html#typing.Annotated) them with <PyObject object="ResourceParam"/>. This annotation lets Dagster know that the parameter is a resource and not an upstream input.

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_raw_github_resource endbefore=end_raw_github_resource dedent=4
from dagster import Definitions, asset, ResourceParam

# `ResourceParam[GitHub]` is treated exactly like `GitHub` for type checking purposes,
# and the runtime type of the github parameter is `GitHub`. The purpose of the
# `ResourceParam` wrapper is to let Dagster know that `github` is a resource and not an
# upstream asset.

@asset
def public_github_repos(github: ResourceParam[GitHub]):
    return github.organization("dagster-io").repositories()

defs = Definitions(
    assets=[public_github_repos],
    resources={"github": GitHub(...)},
)
```

---

## Testing configurable resources

You can test the initialization of a <PyObject object="ConfigurableResource"/> by constructing it manually. In most cases, the resource can be constructed directly:

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_testing endbefore=end_new_resource_testing dedent=4
from dagster import ConfigurableResource

class MyResource(ConfigurableResource):
    value: str

    def get_value(self) -> str:
        return self.value

def test_my_resource():
    assert MyResource(value="foo").get_value() == "foo"
```

If the resource requires other resources, you can pass them as constructor arguments:

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_testing_with_nesting endbefore=end_new_resource_testing_with_nesting dedent=4
from dagster import ConfigurableResource

class StringHolderResource(ConfigurableResource):
    value: str

class MyResourceRequiresAnother(ConfigurableResource):
    foo: StringHolderResource
    bar: str

def test_my_resource_with_nesting():
    string_holder = StringHolderResource(value="foo")
    resource = MyResourceRequiresAnother(foo=string_holder, bar="bar")
    assert resource.foo.value == "foo"
    assert resource.bar == "bar"
```

### Testing with resource context

In the case that a resource uses the resource initialization context, you can use the <PyObject object="build_init_resource_context"/> utility alongside the `with_init_resource_context` helper on the resource class:

```python file=/concepts/resources/pythonic_resources.py startafter=start_new_resource_testing_with_context endbefore=end_new_resource_testing_with_context dedent=4
from dagster import (
    ConfigurableResource,
    build_init_resource_context,
    DagsterInstance,
)
from typing import Optional

class MyContextResource(ConfigurableResource[GitHub]):
    base_path: Optional[str] = None

    def effective_base_path(self) -> str:
        if self.base_path:
            return self.base_path
        instance = self.get_resource_context().instance
        assert instance
        return instance.storage_directory()

def test_my_context_resource():
    with DagsterInstance.ephemeral() as instance:
        context = build_init_resource_context(instance=instance)
        assert (
            MyContextResource(base_path=None)
            .with_resource_context(context)
            .effective_base_path()
            == instance.storage_directory()
        )
```

## Next steps

Resources are a powerful way to encapsulate reusable logic in your assets and ops. For more information on the supported config types for resources, see [the advanced config types documentation](/concepts/configuration/advanced-config-types). For information on the Dagster config system, which you can use to parameterize assets and ops, refer to the [run configuration documentation](/concepts/configuration/config-schema).
