# Auto-Materializing Assets <Experimental />

You can set up Dagster to automatically materialize assets when criteria are met. This enables a declarative approach to asset scheduling â€“ instead of defining imperative workflows to materialize your assets, you just describe the conditions under which they should be materialized.

At a high-level, the most common way for assets to be auto-materialized is "eagerly" -- immediately after upstream changes occur, a run will be kicked off to incorporate those changes into a given asset. However, the precise rules that govern when runs are kicked off can be customized on an asset-by-asset basis.

## Turning on auto-materializing

To enable assets to be automatically materialized, you need to first flip a toggle in the Dagster UI.

- If you're using an open source Dagster deployment, you can get to this toggle by clicking "Deployment" in the top navigation pane and then clicking on the "Daemons" tab.
- If you're using Dagster Cloud, you can get to this toggle by clicking "Deployment" in the top navigation pane, then clicking on the "Agents" tab, then looking under "Cloud service statuses".

## Auto-materialize policies

You can set up an asset to be auto-materialized by assigning it an <PyObject object="AutoMaterializePolicy" />. Each policy consists of a set of `AutoMaterializeRules`, each representing individual reasons that an asset should be materialized or not at a given point in time. If there's at least one rule determining that the asset should be materialized, and no rules determining that it should be skipped, a run will be launched to materialize that asset.

It is recommended to start with the built-in <PyObject object="AutoMaterializePolicy.eager" /> and further customize from there if necessary. This policy consists of all of the supported rules, other than `skip_on_not_all_parents_updated`. The supported rules are currently:

| Name                                                                                     | Description                                                                                                                                                              |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" method="materialize_on_parent_updated" />         | Materialize an asset partition if one of its parents has been updated more recently than it has.                                                                         |
| <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" method="materialize_on_missing" />                | Materialize an asset partition if it has never been materialized before.                                                                                                 |
| <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" method="materialize_on_required_for_freshness" /> | Materialize an asset partition if it is required to satisfy a <PyObject object="FreshnessPolicy" /> of this asset or one of its downstream assets.                       |
| <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" method="skip_on_parent_missing" />                | Skip materializing an asset partition if one of its parent asset partitions has never been materialized (for regular assets) or observed (for observable source assets). |
| <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" method="skip_on_parent_outdated" />               | Skip materializing an asset partition if any of its parents has not incorporated the latest data from its ancestors.                                                     |
| <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" method="skip_on_not_all_parents_updated" />       | Skip materializing an asset partition if any of its parents have not been updated since the asset's last materialization.                                                |

In this example, we use <PyObject object="AutoMaterializePolicy" method="eager" /> to indicate that, any time that `asset1` is materialized, `asset2` should be automatically materialized right after:

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_eager.py
from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, asset


@asset
def asset1():
    ...


@asset(auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.eager(), deps=[asset1])
def asset2():
    ...
```

This example assumes that `asset1` will be materialized in some other way - e.g. manually, via a [sensor](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/sensors), or via a [schedule](/concepts/partitions-schedules-sensors/schedules).

### Adding an auto-materialize policy to multiple assets at once

If you want to apply the same <PyObject object="AutoMaterializePolicy" /> to a set of assets, you can use the `auto_materialize_policy` argument when loading them with functions like <PyObject object="load_assets_from_current_module" /> and <PyObject object="load_assets_from_package_module" />.

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_multiple.py
from dagster import (
    AutoMaterializePolicy,
    Definitions,
    asset,
    load_assets_from_current_module,
)


@asset
def asset1():
    ...


@asset(deps=[asset1])
def asset2():
    ...


defs = Definitions(
    assets=load_assets_from_current_module(
        auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.eager(),
    )
)
```

### Run tags

Runs triggered by auto-materialize policies are tagged with `dagster/auto_materialize: true`. Additional tags can be configured in [`dagster.yaml` (OSS)](/deployment/dagster-instance#auto-materialize) or [deployment settings (Cloud)](/dagster-cloud/managing-deployments/deployment-settings-reference#auto-materialize).

### Customizing auto-materialize policies

Auto-materialize policies can be customized by adding or removing rules. These changes will be reflected in the UI for individual assets.

#### Auto-materialize only once all parents have been updated

By default, the eager policy will materialize an asset whenever _any_ of its parents have been updated. In cases where an asset has many parents, this may cause more materializations than desired, as each parent update will result in an additional downstream materialization. To avoid this, the `skip_on_not_all_parents_updated` rule can be applied to a given policy to force it to wait until _all_ of an asset's parents have been updated before materializing it.

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_after_all_parents.py
from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, AutoMaterializeRule, asset

wait_for_all_parents_policy = AutoMaterializePolicy.eager().with_rules(
    AutoMaterializeRule.skip_on_not_all_parents_updated()
)


@asset(auto_materialize_policy=wait_for_all_parents_policy)
def asset1(upstream1, upstream2):
    ...
```

#### Auto-materialize even if some parents are missing

By default, the eager policy won't materialize an asset if any of its parents are missing. In some cases, it's desirable to allow the downstream asset to be materialized, even if some of its parent assets/partitions are missing. To enable this, the `skip_on_parent_missing` rule can be removed from a given policy to prevent this from blocking the materialization of an asset.

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_with_missing_parents.py
from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, AutoMaterializeRule, asset

allow_missing_parents_policy = AutoMaterializePolicy.eager().without_rules(
    AutoMaterializeRule.skip_on_parent_missing(),
)


@asset(auto_materialize_policy=allow_missing_parents_policy)
def asset1(upstream1, upstream2):
    ...
```

### Auto-materialization and partitions

Each <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" /> generally applies individually to each partition of a partitioned asset. Here's a pipeline with two daily-partitioned assets that have eager auto-materialize policies. At the end of each day, a partition for that day will be added to the set of partitions for each of the assets. Dagster will notice that the new partitions exist, but have no materializations, and then auto-materialize them.

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_time_partitions.py
from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, DailyPartitionsDefinition, asset


@asset(
    partitions_def=DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date="2020-10-10"),
    auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.eager(),
)
def asset1():
    ...


@asset(
    partitions_def=DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date="2020-10-10"),
    auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.eager(),
    deps=[asset1],
)
def asset2():
    ...
```

If the last partition of `asset1` is re-materialized, e.g. manually from the UI, then the corresponding partition of `asset2` will be auto-materialized after.

By default, a given <PyObject object="AutoMaterializePolicy" /> will not allow more than one partition of an asset to be materialized per minute. Any partitions exceeding this threshold will be discarded. Manual intervention will be required to materialize the discarded partitions.

This threshold may be increased as follows:

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_max_materializations_per_minute.py
from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, DailyPartitionsDefinition, asset


@asset(
    partitions_def=DailyPartitionsDefinition(start_date="2020-10-10"),
    auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.eager(
        max_materializations_per_minute=7
    ),
)
def asset1():
    ...
```

For time-partitioned assets, the `N` most recent partitions will be selected from the set of candidates to be materialized. For other types of partitioned assets, the selection will be random.

### Auto-materialize policies and data versions

[Observable source assets](/concepts/assets/asset-observations#observable-source-assets) are assets that your code doesn't materialize, but that you provide a function for that can tell when they've changed. The <PyObject object="AutoMaterializeRule" method="materialize_on_parent_updated" /> rule incorporates the observed data versions of these assets when determining if it should fire for a downstream asset.

In this example, we check every minute to see whether `source_file` was modified. If it was, then the <PyObject object="AutoMaterializePolicy" /> on `asset1` will cause it to be materialized.

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_observable_source_asset.py
import os

from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, DataVersion, asset, observable_source_asset


@observable_source_asset(auto_observe_interval_minutes=1)
def source_file():
    return DataVersion(str(os.path.getmtime("source_file.csv")))


@asset(
    deps=[source_file],
    auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.eager(),
)
def asset1():
    ...
```

### Auto-materialize policies and freshness policies

<Note>
  {" "}
  Lazy auto-materialize policies do not currently have any effect on partitioned
  assets.{" "}
</Note>

Freshness policies express how fresh an asset needs to be relative to data at the root of the graph. This means that, for an asset to meet its freshness policy, both it and upstream assets need to be materialized in time.

Instead of auto-materializing downstream assets immediately after new upstream data arrives, you can use <PyObject object="AutoMaterializePolicy" method="lazy" /> to materialize assets only when needed to meet an asset's <PyObject object="FreshnessPolicy" />. This allows you to avoid unnecessary materializations.

In this example, even if `asset1` is materialized every hour, `asset2` will only be materialized roughly once per day:

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_lazy.py
from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, FreshnessPolicy, asset


@asset
def asset1():
    ...


@asset(
    auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.lazy(),
    freshness_policy=FreshnessPolicy(maximum_lag_minutes=24 * 60),
    deps=[asset1],
)
def asset2():
    ...
```

Setting a lazy auto-materialize policy on an asset allows it to be auto-materialized to help downstream assets meet their freshness policies. In this example, both `asset2` and `asset3` will be auto-materialized up to once per day to help `asset3` meet its freshness policy. Conversely, if `asset2` did not have an auto-materialize policy, then `asset3` would never become fresh unless `asset2` were materialized in some other way.

```python file=/concepts/assets/auto_materialize_lazy_transitive.py
from dagster import AutoMaterializePolicy, FreshnessPolicy, asset


@asset
def asset1():
    ...


@asset(auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.lazy(), deps=[asset1])
def asset2():
    ...


@asset(
    auto_materialize_policy=AutoMaterializePolicy.lazy(),
    freshness_policy=FreshnessPolicy(maximum_lag_minutes=24 * 60),
    deps=[asset2],
)
def asset3():
    ...
```

If multiple assets with freshness policies depend on the same upstream asset, Dagster will try to materialize the upstream asset at times that allow it to minimize the number of runs of the upstream asset while meeting the downstream freshness policies.
