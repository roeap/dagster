# Workspace files

<Note>This guide is applicable only to Dagster Open Source (OSS).</Note>

Workspace files contain a collection of user-defined [code locations](/concepts/code-locations) and information about where to find them. Code locations loaded via workspace files can contain either a <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object or multiple [repositories](/concepts/repositories-workspaces/repositories).

Workspace files are used by Dagster to load code locations in complex or customized environments, such as a production OSS deployment. For local development within a single Python environment, <PyObject object="Definitions" /> users can use the `-m` or `-f` flags with our CLI tools, or set the `pyproject.toml` file to avoid using command line flags entirely.

## Understanding workspace files

A workspace file tells Dagster where to find code locations. By default, this is a YAML document named `workspace.yaml`. For example:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace.yaml
# workspace.yaml

load_from:
  - python_file: my_file.py
```

Each entry in a workspace file is considered a code location. A code location can contain either a single <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object, a repository, or multiple repositories.

To accommodate incrementally migrating from <PyObject object="repository" decorator /> to <PyObject object="Definitions" />, code locations in a single workspace file can mix and match between definition approaches. For example, `code-location-1` could load a single <PyObject object="Definitions" /> object from a file or module, and `code-location-2` could load multiple repositories.

Each code location is loaded in its own process that Dagster tools use an RPC protocol to communicate with. This process separation allows multiple code locations in different environments to be loaded independently, and ensures that errors in user code can't impact Dagster system code.

## Configuring code locations

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="From a file">

### From a file

To load a code location from a Python file, use the `python_file` key in `workspace.yaml`. The value of `python_file` should specify a path relative to `workspace.yaml` leading to a file that contains a code location definition.

For example, if a code location is in `my_file.py` and the file is in the same folder as `workspace.yaml`, the code location could be loaded using the following:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace.yaml
# workspace.yaml

load_from:
  - python_file: my_file.py
```

**If using <PyObject object="repository" decorator /> to define code locations**, you can identify a single repository within the module using the `attribute` key. The value of this key must be the name of a repository or the name of a function that returns a <PyObject object="RepositoryDefinition" />. For example:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_one_repository.yaml
# workspace.yaml

load_from:
  - python_file:
      relative_path: hello_world_repository.py
      attribute: hello_world_repository
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="From a Python module">

### From a Python module

To load a code location from a local or installed Python module, use the `python_module` key in `workspace.yaml`:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_python_module.yaml
# workspace.yaml

load_from:
  - python_module: hello_world_module
```

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

---

## Loading workspace files

By default, Dagster command-line tools (like `dagster dev`, `dagster-webserver`, or `dagster-daemon run`) look for workspace files (by default, `workspace.yaml`) in the current directory when invoked. This allows you to launch from that directory without the need for command line arguments:

```shell
dagster dev
```

To load the `workspace.yaml` file from a different folder, use the `-w` argument:

```shell
dagster dev -w path/to/workspace.yaml
```

When `dagster dev` is run, Dagster will load all the code locations defined by the workspace file. Refer to the [CLI reference](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-dev) for more info and examples.

If a code location can't be loaded - for example, due to a syntax or some other unrecoverable error - a warning message will display in the Dagster UI. You'll be directed to a status page with a descriptive error and stack trace for any locations Dagster was unable to load.

**Note**: If a code location is re-named or its configuration in a workspace file is modified, you'll need to stop and re-start any running schedules or sensors in that code location. You can do this in the UI by navigating to the [**Deployment overview** page](/concepts/webserver/ui#deployment), clicking a code location, and using the **Schedules** and **Sensors** tabs.

This is required because when you start a schedule or a sensor, a serialized representation of the entry in your workspace file is stored in a database. The Dagster daemon process uses this serialized representation to identify and load your schedule or sensor. If the code location is modified and its schedules and sensors aren't restarted, the Dagster daemon process will use an outdated serialized representation, resulting in issues.

## Running your own gRPC server

By default, Dagster tools automatically create a process on your local machine for each of your code locations. However, it's also possible to run your own gRPC server that's responsible for serving information about your code locations. This can be useful in more complex system architectures that deploy user code separately from the Dagster webserver.

- [Initializing the server](#initializing-the-server)
- [Specifying a Docker image](#specifying-a-docker-image)

### Initializing the server

To initialize the Dagster gRPC server, run the `dagster api grpc` command and include:

- A target file or module. Similar to a workspace file, the target can either be a Python file or module.
- Host address
- Port or socket

The following tabs demonstrate some common ways to initialize a gRPC server:

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Using a Python file">

Running on a port, using a Python file:

```shell
dagster api grpc --python-file /path/to/file.py --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266
```

Running on a socket, using a Python file:

```shell
dagster api grpc --python-file /path/to/file.py --host 0.0.0.0 --socket /path/to/socket
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using a Python module">

Using a Python module:

```shell
dagster api grpc --module-name my_module_name --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Using a specific repository">

<Note>
  This is applicable only for code locations defined using{" "}
  <PyObject object="repository" decorator />.
</Note>

Specifying an attribute within the target to load a specific repository. When run, the server will automatically find and load the specified repositories:

```shell
dagster api grpc --python-file /path/to/file.py --attribute my_repository --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266
```

---

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Local imports">

Specify a working directory to use as the base folder for local imports:

```shell
dagster api grpc --python-file /path/to/file.py --working-directory /var/my_working_dir --host 0.0.0.0 --port 4266
```

---

</TabItem>
</TabGroup>

Refer to the [API docs](/\_apidocs/cli#dagster-api-grpc) for the full list of options that can be set when running a new gRPC server.

Then, in your workspace file, configure a new gRPC server code location to load:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_grpc.yaml
# workspace.yaml

load_from:
  - grpc_server:
      host: localhost
      port: 4266
      location_name: "my_grpc_server"
```

### Specifying a Docker image

When running your own gRPC server within a container, you can tell the webserver that any runs launched from a code location should be launched in a container with that same image.

To do this, set the `DAGSTER_CURRENT_IMAGE` environment variable to the name of the image before starting the server. After setting this environment variable for your server, the image should be listed alongside the code location on the **Status** page in the UI.

This image will only be used by [run launchers](/deployment/run-launcher) and [executors](/deployment/executors) that expect to use Docker images (like the <PyObject module="dagster_docker" object="DockerRunLauncher" />, <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="K8sRunLauncher" />, <PyObject module="dagster_docker" object="docker_executor" />, or <PyObject module="dagster_k8s" object="k8s_job_executor" />).

If you're using the built-in [Helm chart](/deployment/guides/kubernetes/deploying-with-helm), this environment variable is automatically set on each of your gRPC servers.

## Examples

<TabGroup>
<TabItem name="Loading relative imports">

### Loading relative imports

By default, code is loaded with `dagster-webserver`'s working directory as the base path to resolve any local imports in your code. Using the `working_directory` key, you can specify a custom working directory for relative imports. For example:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/workspace_working_directory.yaml
# workspace.yaml

load_from:
  - python_file:
      relative_path: hello_world_repository.py
      working_directory: my_working_directory/
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem name="Loading multiple Python environments">

### Loading multiple Python environments

By default, the webserver and other Dagster tools assume that code locations should be loaded using the same Python environment used to load Dagster. However, it's often useful for code locations to use independent environments. For example, a data engineering team running Spark can have dramatically different dependencies than an ML team running Tensorflow.

To enable this use case, Dagster supports customizing the Python environment for each code location by adding the `executable_path` key to the YAML for a location. These environments can involve distinct sets of installed dependencies, or even completely different Python versions. For example:

```yaml file=/concepts/repositories_workspaces/python_environment_example.yaml
load_from:
  - python_file:
      relative_path: path/to/dataengineering_spark_team.py
      location_name: dataengineering_spark_team_py_38_virtual_env
      executable_path: venvs/path/to/dataengineering_spark_team/bin/python
  - python_file:
      relative_path: path/to/team_code_location.py
      location_name: ml_team_py_36_virtual_env
      executable_path: venvs/path/to/ml_tensorflow/bin/python
```

The example above also illustrates the `location_name` key. Each code location in a workspace file has a unique name that is displayed in the UI, and is also used to disambiguate definitions with the same name across multiple code locations. Dagster will supply a default name for each location based on its workspace entry if a custom one is not supplied.
